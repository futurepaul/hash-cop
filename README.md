# HASH COP

This is meant to be software for verifying your software downloads. So far it can hash a binary and compare that hash against a hash in a manifest file. Next up will be to get PGP in the mix.

The whole point is to make this easy to use for people scared of the command line, so ALL IDEAS ABOUT UX ARE WELCOME. Literally throw any idea into the issues.

My current plan is a wizard that starts with selecting the file you want to verify, then the manifest, then the key of whoever signed the manifest. But please let me know if you have a better idea!
